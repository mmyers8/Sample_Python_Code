# Sample_Python_Code

Here is a few samples of projects that I have developed in python.

I have included a few projects that I believe showcase a variety of my python skills. 
I currently have patent pending status on a python based project that I developed by myself and formed an LLC to license.
I debated pulling parts of it out to showcase my coding but ultimately decided against it. I am very willing to talk about it conversationally but again am hesitant to include it as a showcase to a software development company.
 
1.) Dense Neural Network Classification Model to predict outcomes of the 2021 NFL Playoffs. 

Downloaded free 2021 season stats from https://www.pro-football-reference.com/ and pre-processed the data in order to feed into the model. 

Training data = 2021 regular season stats/outcomes

Test data = 2021 playoff outcomes/outcomes

Model Test Set Accuracy = 0.60 or 60 % or 6/10 playoff games

Model Prediction for Sunday 1/30/21:
'CIN' : prob of 51.6%
'SF' prob of 51.5%


2.) Program developed at URMC to control a custom made device to collect Ultrasound images for the purpose of developing a longitudinal model of flexor tendon healing. Patient ultrasound scans  were collected and saved by this program that launched a graphical user interface (GUI) to control a stepper motor that moved an ultrasound probe along the length of the flexor tendon. The live ultrasound feed was mirrored within the GUI and the ultrasound video files were saved for post-processing. A 3D reconstruction of the patient's injury was made using the saved data. These 3D reconstructions were then compared over time to develop a longitudinal model of tendon healing.

3.) Simple Biomechanics program to collect Biomechanics data using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The program tracks the movement of individuals via a live webcam and records positional movements that can be turned into usable info with some math. The program as it sits can measure the live angle of arms, knees, etc. This is a fairly simplistic use case for this program but with some further development and some math, could be a robust sports/general biomechanics collection and analysis tool.
